# Image Face Recognition

Face recognition is a method of identifying or verifying the identity of an individual using their face. Face recognition systems can be used to identify people in photos, video, or in real-time. Law enforcement may also use mobile devices to identify people during police stops. 

But face recognition data can be prone to error, which can implicate people for crimes they havenâ€™t committed. Facial recognition software is particularly bad at recognizing African Americans and other ethnic minorities, women, and young people, often misidentifying or failing to identify them, disparately impacting certain groups.

## About it

The program walks through the known directory of images and stores all the facial encodings in a file which is the training process.
Run the `test.py` file for testing process of all the files in unknown folder.
You may train the model on your own images provided the file name has to be the same person's name.

Here are some sample examples
